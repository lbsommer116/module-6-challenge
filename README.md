# Part 1: Weather 
I used open weather data to determine the relationship between latitude and different weather conditions (i.e. temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed) in both the northern and southern hemispheres.

I then plotted the cities on a map, with sizing based on humidity of each city.


# Part 2: Vacation

I used the coordinated of cities to determine the closest hotels withing a 100k radius. I then plotted these hotels on a map, with the ability to hover over the points to see the cities and closest hotel
